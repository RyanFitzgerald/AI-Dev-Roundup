### [Small Language Models are the Future of Agentic AI (Research paper)](https://e.aidevroundup.com/p/click?url=https%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fabs%2F2506.02153&s=[[subscriberToken]])

The authors argue that small language models (SLMs) are more efficient,
cost-effective, and better suited than LLMs for most repetitive, specialized
tasks in agentic AI systems. They propose shifting from LLMs to SLMs, using
heterogeneous systems when general conversation is needed, to reduce costs and
optimize AI resource use.
