Large context windows can hurt LLM performance and increase costs, with
benchmarks showing steep drops beyond 120k tokens. Best practice is ‚Äúcontext
engineering‚Äù: keep prompts concise, disable unneeded tools, and start fresh
sessions to avoid bloat.

### [Understanding LLMs: Insights from Mechanistic Interpretability (Guide)](https://e.aidevroundup.com/p/click?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lesswrong.com%2Fposts%2FXGHf7EY3CK4KorBpw%2Funderstanding-llms-insights-from-mechanistic&s=[[subscriberToken]])

Transformer LLMs generate text through tokenization, embeddings, attention, and
