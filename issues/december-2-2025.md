### [Data center energy demand forecasted to soar nearly 300% through 2035 (3min read)](https://e.aidevroundup.com/p/click?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F12%2F01%2Fdata-center-energy-demand-forecasted-to-soar-nearly-300-through-2035&s=[[subscriberToken]])

Data center power demand is set to reach 106 GW by 2035 as far larger facilities
and a surge in AI-driven workloads fuel rapid expansion, especially in the PJM
region and Texas, prompting warnings that grid capacity may struggle to keep up.

### [Nvidia releases open-source software for self-driving car development (1min read)](https://e.aidevroundup.com/p/click?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reuters.com%2Ftechnology%2Fnvidia-releases-open-source-software-self-driving-car-development-2025-12-01&s=[[subscriberToken]])

Nvidia released Alpamayo-R1, an open-source self-driving model that narrates its
reasoning as it interprets road scenes and plans movements, offering greater
transparency to help developers diagnose and improve autonomous-vehicle
behavior.

## 🛠️ Dev Tools & Frameworks

DeepSeekMath-V2 uses a self-verifying approach to train a proof generator and
verifier that improve mathematical rigor, enabling strong theorem-proving
performance including gold-level IMO 2025 and a 118/120 Putnam 2024 score.

### [Token-Oriented Object Notation (TOON) (GitHub)](https://e.aidevroundup.com/p/click?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ftoon-format%2Ftoon&s=[[subscriberToken]])

Compact, human-readable, schema-aware JSON for LLM prompts.

### [Introducing AI assistants with memory (Tooling)](https://e.aidevroundup.com/p/click?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.perplexity.ai%2Fhub%2Fblog%2Fintroducing-ai-assistants-with-memory&s=[[subscriberToken]])

Perplexity now uses a secure memory system that stores preferences and past
conversations to deliver more precise, personalized answers across all models,
offering continuity, context portability, and full user control over what is
remembered.

## ⚡ Quick Bits

### [Nano Banana Pro is available in Flow (X.com)](https://e.aidevroundup.com/p/click?url=https%3A%2F%2Fx.com%2Fflowbygoogle%2Fstatus%2F1992034924636053552&s=[[subscriberToken]])

It is available to all Google AI subscribers, now including Pro and Plus.

### [You can now use ChatGPT Voice right inside chat (X.com)](https://e.aidevroundup.com/p/click?url=https%3A%2F%2Fx.com%2Fopenai%2Fstatus%2F1993381101369458763&s=[[subscriberToken]])

You can talk, watch answers appear, review earlier messages, and see visuals
like images or maps in real time.

### [OpenAI is planning to start testing ads on ChatGPT soon (X.com)](https://e.aidevroundup.com/p/click?url=https%3A%2F%2Fx.com%2Ftestingcatalog%2Fstatus%2F1994716871246168176&s=[[subscriberToken]])

New ad related strings appeared in the latest build for Android and will likely
be limited to search ads only.

### [Perplexity's global app downloads have dropped 80% in the last six weeks (X.com)](https://e.aidevroundup.com/p/click?url=https%3A%2F%2Fx.com%2FSashaKaletsky%2Fstatus%2F1993179567046135938&s=[[subscriberToken]])

Equally concerning is what the drop implies: that the earlier growth was mostly
from paid marketing (organic growth rarely drops that quickly).

## 📌 Deep Dive

### [How prompt caching works (Guide)](https://e.aidevroundup.com/p/click?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsankalp.bearblog.dev%2Fhow-prompt-caching-works&s=[[subscriberToken]])

This guide explains how prompt caching really works, showing that KV-cache reuse
depends on identical prefixes across requests and is enabled by vLLM’s
paged-attention, which maps token blocks to reusable hashed memory pages for
efficient, scalable inference.

### [Does AI-Assisted Coding Deliver? A Difference-in-Differences Study of Cursor’s Impact on Software Projects (Research)](https://e.aidevroundup.com/p/click?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.alphaxiv.org%2Fabs%2F2511.04427v2&s=[[subscriberToken]])

A diff-in-diff study of GitHub projects shows Cursor adoption briefly
accelerates development but consistently raises static analysis warnings and
code complexity, which later contribute to slowed long-term velocity.
