GPT‚Äë5 is smarter across the board, providing more useful responses across math,
science, finance, law, and more. It also produces high-quality code, generates
front-end UI with minimal prompting, and shows improvements to personality,
steerability, and executing long chains of tool calls.

OpenAI releases gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b: Apache-2.0 open-weight models with
strong tool use and 128k context. 120b nears o4-mini and runs on one 80GB GPU;
20b matches o3-mini and fits 16GB devices. Weights (MXFP4), tokenizer, and tools
ship with a safety-vetted model card.

### [Genie 3: A new frontier for world models (7min read)](https://e.aidevroundup.com/p/click?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeepmind.google%2Fdiscover%2Fblog%2Fgenie-3-a-new-frontier-for-world-models%2F&s=[[subscriberToken]])

Google DeepMind unveils Genie 3, a real-time world model that generates
interactive 720p environments at 24 fps from text prompts, keeping them
consistent for minutes. It adds promptable world events, supports embodied-agent
research, and launches as a limited research preview.

### [Grok Imagine, xAI‚Äôs new AI image and video generator, lets you make NSFW content (3min read)](https://e.aidevroundup.com/p/click?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F08%2F04%2Fgrok-imagine-xais-new-ai-image-and-video-generator-lets-you-make-nsfw-content%2F&s=[[subscriberToken]])

xAI‚Äôs Grok Imagine rolls out on X‚Äôs iOS for SuperGrok and Premium+ users,
generating images and 15-sec videos from prompts. A ‚Äúspicy mode‚Äù allows NSFW
with moderation and celebrity limits; results feel uncanny, but the UX is fast
and slick.

### [Sam Altman addresses ‚Äòbumpy‚Äô GPT-5 rollout, bringing 4o back, and the ‚Äòchart crime‚Äô (3min read)](https://e.aidevroundup.com/p/click?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F08%2F08%2Fsam-altman-addresses-bumpy-gpt-5-rollout-bringing-4o-back-and-the-chart-crime%2F&s=[[subscriberToken]])

At a Reddit AMA, Sam Altman said GPT-5 seemed ‚Äúdumber‚Äù because the autoswitcher
failed at launch. He promised fixes, clearer model transparency, doubled Plus
rate limits, is considering restoring 4o for Plus, and called the benchmark
chart a ‚Äúmega screwup.‚Äù

### [Elon Musk‚Äôs Grok Ad Plans Expose The Fragility Of AI Neutrality (6min read)](https://e.aidevroundup.com/p/click?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fjasonsnyder%2F2025%2F08%2F08%2Fgrok-and-the-death-of-ai-neutrality-the-sponsored-mind%2F&s=[[subscriberToken]])

X will place ads inside Grok‚Äôs answers, collapsing the line between utility and
promotion. The piece defines AI Neutrality‚Äôs pillars (consent, separation,
pluralism, transparency, sensitive-context limits), warns of manipulation and
privacy risks, and urges user-controlled fetch-agent models.

### [OpenAI priced GPT-5 so low, it may spark a price war (4min read)](https://e.aidevroundup.com/p/click?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F08%2F08%2Fopenai-priced-gpt-5-so-low-it-may-spark-a-price-war%2F&s=[[subscriberToken]])

OpenAI launches GPT-5 days after its open models and despite Altman calling it
‚Äúthe best,‚Äù it only slightly beats rivals on some benchmarks. That said, it's
pricing ($1.25/M input, $10/M output, $0.125/M cached) pressures Google and
undercuts Anthropic.

## üõ†Ô∏è Dev Tools & Frameworks

### [opencode (GitHub)](https://e.aidevroundup.com/p/click?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fsst%2Fopencode&s=[[subscriberToken]])

## üìå Deep Dive

### [Persona vectors: Monitoring and controlling character traits in language models (Research paper)](https://e.aidevroundup.com/p/click?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anthropic.com%2Fresearch%2Fpersona-vectors&s=[[subscriberToken]])

AI models have unstable personalities. Researchers can now identify "persona
vectors"‚Äîneural network patterns that control specific traits like evil or
sycophancy. This allows for monitoring and mitigating undesirable behaviors to
keep AI aligned and safe.
